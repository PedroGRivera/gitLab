bcai_v* are design folders for project BCAI.

metaCoin, petShop are original example from Truffle suite.
payroll is an example desiged by Tao to practise and understand solidity syntax.
MarksWill* is example from LSU Blockchain course using solidity, truffle and webpack as frontend.
eventTest is an simple example to test how to interact with EVENTS.
ipfsLab is an example to try using IPFS. For details, visit their website which has a video tutorial.
quickTest is an setted-up environment to quickly try out something fun.

NOTE: the design with frontend is using React env, (bcai_v2.0 as an example) which is different from typical truffle env. Use caution to put files in the right place.
